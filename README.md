### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2018

+ Projec title: U.S Presidents Inauguration Speeches Analysis
+ This project is conducted by Lan Wen

+ Project summary: Presidential inauguration speech is one of the most important speeches delivered by U.S presidents during the term of office. Presidents from different eras, parties and backgrounds may be interested in different topics and have different ways of speaking. I believe by analyzing these speeches, we are definitely able to find out some interesting insights from them. In this project, I used text mining and data visualization techniques to conduct the analysis and my goal is to obtain the answers of the following questions:
1. What are the main topics that presidents from Republican and Democratic party care about respectively? Do these topics that presidents care about change across time?
2. What are the characteristics of speeches delivered by presidents with different backgrounds?
